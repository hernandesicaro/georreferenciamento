# Test

Just setting the test project for the geolocation of zip codes.

After searching for a free way to geolocate the brazilian zip codes, I came to the conclusion that there is no cheap, feaseble way to do this. At least not in the volume I need for my project (roughly 5000 zip codes per year through 15 years).
